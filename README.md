## 303duino

An Arduino synth using mozzi library.

The goal of this project is to create a TB-303 like midi synthesizer with:
- ADSR envelope
- Low pass filter
- Midi control
- Multiple waveform
- Distorsion
- Reverb

The project is under development.
At this moment there isn't midi control but only a music loop to test the sound.
To hear that music, connect a 3.5mm audio jack with the centre wire to the Digital Pin 9 on Arduino, and the ground to the Ground on the Arduino.

I'm using an Arduino Nano but this should work with many other boards.
